# What You Need to Provide for Docker Setup

Based on the verification script results, here's exactly what you need to provide to ensure your Docker setup works correctly:

## ✅ What's Already Working

Your system has passed all critical checks:
- ✅ Docker is installed and running
- ✅ Docker Compose is available
- ✅ All project files are present
- ✅ Internet connectivity is working
- ✅ Sufficient system resources (92GB disk, 8GB RAM)
- ✅ Docker functionality is working

## 🔑 What You Need to Provide

### 1. **OpenAI API Key** (Required)
**Status**: ⚠️ Missing - You need to create this

**How to get it:**
1. Go to https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Sign in or create an account
3. Click "Create new secret key"
4. Copy the key (it starts with `sk-`)

**How to add it:**
```bash
# Create the .env file
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-api-key-here" > .env

# Verify it was created
cat .env
```

**Important**: 
- Replace `sk-your-actual-api-key-here` with your real key
- Never commit this file to git (it's already in .gitignore)
- The key is required for the LLM functionality to work

### 2. **PDF Documents** (Required for functionality)
**Status**: ⚠️ Missing - You need to add these

**What to provide:**
- Any PDF files you want to ask questions about
- Documents will be processed and stored in the vector database

**How to add them:**
```bash
# Create data directory (if not exists)
mkdir -p data

# Copy your PDF files
cp /path/to/your/document1.pdf data/
cp /path/to/your/document2.pdf data/

# Verify files are there
ls -la data/
```

**Examples of good documents:**
- Research papers
- Manuals
- Reports
- Articles
- Any text-heavy PDFs

## 🚀 Quick Setup Commands

Once you have the API key and documents:

```bash
# 1. Create .env file with your API key
echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-key" > .env

# 2. Add PDF files to data/ directory
# (Copy your PDF files to the data/ folder)

# 3. Build and start the application
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d

# 4. Process your documents
docker-compose exec rag-app python docker-ingest.py

# 5. Access the app
# Open http://localhost:8501 in your browser
```

## 📋 Pre-Launch Checklist

Before running the application, verify:

- [ ] `.env` file exists with valid OpenAI API key
- [ ] `data/` directory contains at least one PDF file
- [ ] Docker Desktop is running
- [ ] You have at least 5GB free disk space
- [ ] You have at least 4GB available RAM

## 🧪 Test Your Setup

Run this command to verify everything is ready:

```bash
./verify-docker-setup.sh
```

You should see:
- ✅ All critical checks passed
- ⚠️ Only warnings about missing .env and documents (which you'll fix)

## 🎯 Expected Results

After providing the API key and documents:

1. **Build**: `docker-compose build` should complete successfully
2. **Start**: `docker-compose up -d` should start both services
3. **Ingestion**: Document processing should show success messages
4. **Access**: http://localhost:8501 should show the Streamlit interface
5. **Queries**: You should be able to ask questions about your documents

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### Common Issues:

1. **"Invalid API key"**
   - Check that your API key starts with `sk-`
   - Verify the key is correct in the .env file

2. **"No documents found"**
   - Make sure PDF files are in the `data/` directory
   - Check file permissions

3. **"Build failed"**
   - Check internet connection
   - Try: `docker-compose build --no-cache`

4. **"Port already in use"**
   - Stop other applications using ports 8501 or 6333
   - Or change ports in docker-compose.yml

### Getting Help:
- Check logs: `docker-compose logs`
- Run verification: `./verify-docker-setup.sh`
- See troubleshooting in `DOCKER_FOR_BEGINNERS.md`

## 📊 Summary

**You need to provide exactly 2 things:**

1. **OpenAI API Key** → Create `.env` file
2. **PDF Documents** → Add to `data/` directory

**Everything else is already working perfectly!** 🎉

Your Docker environment is ready to go - you just need these two pieces of information to make the RAG application functional.
